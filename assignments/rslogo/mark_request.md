## Design Excellence

If you have completed a "design excellence" task, please write what
the task was below (note, it MUST be on the list in the assignment or
approved by COMP6991 staff).

> Build your program so it is as close to zero-copy as possible. This is design excellence because it requires you to think about how to write a performant program, and to think about how to avoid allocating memory.

> Get 80% test coverage for your application. You could use a library like tarpaulin to calculate your test coverage.
Consider approaching this assignment in a Test-Driven Development style if you're aiming for this design excellence.
This is design excellence because it requires you to think about how to test your program, and to design a testable program.

Please write a paragraph or two (max. 250 words) describing how your design was
influenced by this challenge, with specific reference to sections of your code.
If you completed the "Pull Request" design excellence, please just leave a link
to your PR.
